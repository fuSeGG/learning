            50 years
            10 years
            3 years
            1 years
            1 month
            1 week
            
            No-time
                (unsorted, or doesn't fit with time?)
            
            Specific time
                + Birthday etc.
                + Calendar system currently deals with this, but may just be integrated so as to automatically plot it into week schedule.
                + An optional preparation component (say for a birthday, a gift may need to be bought well ahead of the date of the event itself)

        Functionality:
            
            Automatically updates to the current month.
                Things that wasn't completed last month enters new month (or (special) unsorted category?)
        
            Visual Representation: 
                Overview system
                    Colour legend
                 
        
            Keeps archive of completed tasks
        
        Design choices to be made:

            Should the interface be based on the named months? Or more flexibly the next 30 days? Fluid vs Rigid system.


        Potential add-on:
            
            Gamification
                Point system
        */
